# TweetSimulator
A currently very simple web app that reads through a person's Twitter feed and uses Markov chaining to attempt to simulate their tweets.

### TODO
* Fix getting stuck reading certain user's tweets (e.g. @preposterousbee)
* Generate tweets longer than a sentence
* Allow newlines
* Rent a server and register a domain
